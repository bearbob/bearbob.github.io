Hi there and welcome to my personal blog!
I use this space to explore my own thoughts in writing, focusing on engineering processes, leadership and professional growth.

Creating my own video games was my gateway into the software engineering world. Over the years solving problems has become my passion and everyday motivation.
I love to contiously test my limits, while continuing to improve the skills i already have - Always aiming to be better than yesterday.

I believe that work should be both fun and challenging and that teams excells when they can trust and support each other - from the smallest to the biggest tasks.
